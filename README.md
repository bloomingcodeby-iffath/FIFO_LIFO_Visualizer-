## Overview
The **FIFO-LIFO Visualizer** is a Java Swing application that provides an interactive and visual representation of two fundamental data structures: **Stack (LIFO)** and **Queue (FIFO)**. Users can perform operations like push/pop for stacks and enqueue/dequeue for queues while observing animations that illustrate how these structures work internally.

## Features

### Welcome Screen
- Intuitive welcome frame with Stack and Queue options.
- Images representing each data structure.

### Stack Visualizer (LIFO)
- Push elements onto the stack.
- Pop elements from the stack.
- Clear the stack entirely.
- Visual representation with dynamic animation.
- Highlights the **Top** element.
- Stack size is user-defined (1–10).

### Queue Visualizer (FIFO)
- Enqueue elements into the queue.
- Dequeue elements from the queue.
- Clear the queue entirely.
- Animated visualization of element movements.
- Highlights **Front** and **Rear** elements.
- Queue size is user-defined (1–10).
